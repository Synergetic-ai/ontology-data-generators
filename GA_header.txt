 1: DB, database contributing the file (always "SGD" for this file).
 2: DB_Object_ID, SGDID (SGD's unique identifier for genes and
    features).
 3: DB_Object_Symbol, see below
 4: Qualifier (optional), one or more of 'NOT', 'contributes_to',
    'colocalizes_with' as qualifier(s) for a GO annotation, when needed,
    multiples separated by pipe (|)
 5: GO ID, unique numeric identifier for the GO term
 6: DB:Reference(|DB:Reference), the reference associated with the GO
    annotation
 7: Evidence, the evidence code for the GO annotation
 8: With (or) From (optional), any With or From qualifier for the GO
    annotation
 9: Aspect, which ontology the GO term belongs (Function, Process or
    Component)
10: DB_Object_Name(|Name) (optional), a name for the gene product in
    words, e.g. 'acid phosphatase'
11: DB_Object_Synonym(|Synonym) (optional), see below
12: DB_Object_Type, type of object annotated, e.g. gene, protein, etc.
13: taxon(|taxon), taxonomic identifier of species encoding gene
    product
14: Date, date GO annotation was defined in the format YYYYMMDD
15: Assigned_by, source of the annotation (always "SGD" for this file)
16: Annotation Extension, optional, Contains cross references to other
    ontologies that can be used to qualify or enhance the
    annotation. The cross-reference is prefaced by an appropriate GO
    relationship; references to multiple ontologies can be
    entered. For example, if a gene product is localized to the
    mitochondria of lymphocytes, the GO ID (column 5) would be
    mitochondrion ; GO:0005439, and the annotation extension column
    would contain a cross-reference to the term lymphocyte from the
    Cell Type Ontology.
17: Gene Product Form ID, optional, this field allows the annotation
    of specific variants of that gene or gene
    product. UniProtKB:P12345-2
